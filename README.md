<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

Predicting the sale value of a home can be difficult for homeowners who are looking to put their home on the market. The intention of this project is to create a "virtual appraisal" model that captures the housing market in Ames Iowa from 2006-2010, and can predict the sale price of a house based on the property's features.

### Datasets
The Ames Housing dataset was sourced and designed by a professor who wanted a better dataset to use for an undergraduate regression course, that would mimic real life data, and expose students to issues they may encounter while trying to build models in the workforce. The original journal article about the creation of this dataset is here: [Ames, Iowa: Alternative to the Boston Housing Data as an
End of Semester Regression Project](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf).
The data contains over 70 columns of different features (of nominal, discrete, and ordinal types) to describe properties in Ames, Iowa that were sold between the years 2006-2010.
    
The data dictionary can be found at http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt, or in the project files.
